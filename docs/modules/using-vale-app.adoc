= Analyzing your content by using the Vale-at-Red-Hat web app

To get familiar with Vale without installing the Vale software on your local client, you can use the Vale-at-Red-Hat web app. 
This web app is preconfigured to analyze your content by using Red Hat's style rules.

.Prerequisites
* You must have Docker or Podman installed on your system.
* Optional: To use AI-powered issue fixing, install and run https://ollama.ai/[Ollama] on your host machine with at least one model (for example, `ollama pull granite4:latest`).

.Procedure
. Run the following command to download the image and start the container:
+
[source,terminal]
----
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 quay.io/ganelson/vale-online-app
----
. Open your browser and go to `+http://localhost:8080+`.
. Paste the content you want to check in the text area and click *Lint*.
+
[NOTE]
====
By default, the Vale-at-Red-Hat web app displays warnings and errors only. You can also view suggestions by using the options menu on the left.
====
. Optional: If Ollama is available, click *Fix issues with AI* to automatically fix linting issues. Select which issues to fix, review the AI suggestions, and apply the changes.
. To close the app, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the container is running.
