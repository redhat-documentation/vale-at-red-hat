Consider xref:user-guide.adoc#creating-a-vocabulary-for-a-project[creating a vocabulary for a project] when:

* Missing words in the Vale dictionary are causing Spelling errors
* The word is too specific to benefit other projects.

Consider xref:contributor-guide.adoc#extending-styles[Extending styles] when:

* Missing words in the Vale dictionary are causing Spelling errors
* Adding the word will benefit other projects. For example: product and tool names, common terms specific to the software industry.
