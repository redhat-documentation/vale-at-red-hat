= Collating Vale output

You can use a template to collate the results from running `vale` on the command line. This collated output is non-repetitive and might be easier to use.

The `RedHat` style includes a `collate-output.tmpl` template you can specify when you run the `vale` command. For example:

----
$ cd openshift-docs/
$ vale --output='.vale/styles/RedHat/collate-output.tmpl' modules/about-crio.adoc
----

The resulting command output collates any repetitive suggestions, warnings, or errors.

.Example `vale` output from the `collate-output.tmpl` template
----
 modules/about-crio.adoc

 7:9,11:107  suggestion  Define acronyms and             RedHat.Definitions
                         abbreviations (such as 'CRI')
                         on first occurrence if they're
                         likely to be unfamiliar.

0 errors, 0 warnings and 2 suggestions in 1 file.

[NOTE]
====
When you use the `--output` option, other options such as `--minAlertLevel` might not work.
