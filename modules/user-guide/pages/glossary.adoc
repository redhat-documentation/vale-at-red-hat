Consider xref:creating-a-vocabulary-for-a-project.adoc[] when:

* Missing words in the Vale dictionary are causing Spelling errors
* The word is too specific to benefit to other projects.

Consider xref:contributor-guide:extending-the-spelling-rule.adoc[] when:

* Missing words in the Vale dictionary are causing Spelling errors
* Adding the word will benefit to other projects. For example: product and tool names, common terms specific to the software industry.
